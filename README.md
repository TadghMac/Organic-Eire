Design Ideas for UX

 Organic  Éire is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, catering to users with varying levels of computer literacy. I believe in providing a straightforward and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate the application effortlessly.


Key Design Principles:
Minimalistic Interface: I adopt a minimalistic design approach, keeping the user interface clean and clutter-free. This helps reduce cognitive load and makes it easier for users to focus on the essential features of the application.


Intuitive Navigation: Navigation within the application is designed to be intuitive and logical. Users should be able to find the information they need quickly and without confusion.


Clear Communication: I prioritize clear and concise communication throughout the application. This includes using plain language, providing helpful tooltips and instructions, and avoiding technical jargon whenever possible.


Responsive Design: Our application is built with responsive design principles, ensuring that it functions seamlessly across devices of all sizes. Whether users access the application on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, they can expect a consistent and optimal experience.



Initial Design and Planning

In the inital planning , the app was going to have a classidieds section with CRUD funcionality but I chose not to impliment this in this version.
